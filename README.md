plex-trakt-scrobbler
=====================

plex-trakt-scrobbler provides a set of scripts that allow you to scrobble played episodes items to TVShow Time from the Plex Media Server application. plex-trakt-scrobbler was built to run across platforms, while it has not yet been tested on Windows, it *should* work.

A few points

  - plex-trakt-scrobbler is an out of process tool. Meaning it is not a Plex Media Server plug-in. This tool runs separately of your Plex Media Server.
  - Must be run on the Plex Media Server
  - Uses python standard library. Python is the only requirement to run this application
  - Parses Plex Media Server logs for the 'got played' string in the log file.
  - Does not differentiate between clients. Meaning all media played, will be scrobbled while the script is running.
  - Your plex-media-server logs must be set at DEBUG level (not VERBOSE)

Installation
----

**Linux, OSX**

It is recommended (but not required) that you install this into a virtualenvironment.

```
virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/plex-trakt-scrobbler
source ~/.virtualenvs/plex-trakt-scrobbler/bin/activate
```

Fetch and install the source from the github repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/jesseward/plex-trakt-scrobbler.git
cd plex-trakt-scrobbler
python setup.py install

```

Alternatively, you can fetch the latest zip from github

```
wget https://github.com/jesseward/plex-trakt-scrobbler/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd plex-trakt-scrobbler-master
python setup.py install
```

You're done.

**Windows**
Note: any feedback regarding MS Windows functionality is appreciated.

*  Download and install Python 2.7.x from https://www.python.org/download/ . Ensure you enable the option to install Python to the system/site path.
*  Download the zip of plex-trakt-scrobbler from https://github.com/jesseward/plex-trakt-scrobbler/archive/master.zip .
* unzip archive to a temporary location. for this example we will use c:\temp\plex-trakt-scrobbler\
* Open a command prompt and change to the \temp folder
```
cd c:\temp\plex-trakt-scrobbler\
```
* in the c:\temp\plex-trakt-scrobbler\ directory, run the installer from the dos prompt
```
python setup.py install
```
The above command installs the python scripts to various locations. Directories of interest are :
* c:\Python27\scripts\
* .config  - this directory is created in your Users home directory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory#Default_home_directory_per_operating_system). You will need to modify the configuration file from within this directory and point log locations at the appropriate locations for Plex on windows. You can set the "log_file" property to c:\temp or some other location which you wish to write logs to.

To run the application, do the following from a DOS prompt
```
cd c:\Python27\scripts
python plex-trakt-scrobbler.py
```

Configuration
-----------

The plex-trakt-scrobbler configuration file (plex_trakt_scrobbler.conf) is installed to ~/.config/plex-trakt-scrobbler/ . The following configuration values are available.

If you're running Plex Media Server on a Linux based operating system, things should work out of the box.

```
# REQUIRED: mediaserver_url is the location of the http service exposed by Plex Media Server
# the default values should be 'ok', assuming you're running the plex scrobble
# script from the same server as your plex media server
mediaserver_url = 'http://localhost:32400'

# REQUIRED: a python data struture that stores failed scrobbles. plex-trakt-scrobbler
# will retry on a 60 minute interval, maximum of 10 attempts if tvshowtime.com is
# experiencing issues.
cache_location = tmp/plex_trakt_scrobbler.cache

# REQUIRED: mediaserver_log_location references the log file location of the plex media server
# the default under /var/lib/... is the default install of plex media server on
# a Linux system. You may wish to change this value to reference your OS install.
mediaserver_log_location = '/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Logs/Plex Media Server.log'

# REQUIRED: Where do you wish to write the plex-trakt-scrobbler log file.
log_file = /tmp/plex_trakt_scrobbler.log

```

Running
--------

If you installed plex-trakt-scrobbler to a virtual environment, enable the virtual env.

```
source ~/.virtualenvs/plex-trakt-scrobbler/bin/activate
```

run the application
```
$ plex-trakt-scrobbler.py
```
On first run you will be prompted to authenticate and grant access to your TVShow Time account. Visit the URL generated by plex-trakt-scrobbler and follow the prompts to grant access to the application.

Example.


```
$ plex-trakt-scrobbler.py

== Requesting tvshowtime.com auth ==

Please do the following to authorize the scrobbler:

1/ Connect on https://www.tvshowtime.com/activate
2/ Enter the code: xxxx-xxxx

Have you authorized me [y/N] :

```

Once this is complete, please re-start the service, listen to audio via Plex and watch as your music is scrobbled. You may wish to leave the service running in the background. On a POSIX system, wrap the script in the no-hangup utility.

```
$ nohup plex-trakt-scrobbler.py &
```

Troubleshooting & Known Issues
-------------

* If you're experiencing authentication issues (appearing in plex_trakt_scrobbler.log), remove the ~/.config/plex-trakt-scrobbler/session file. This stores your TVShow Time authentication token. There is no harm in removing/recreating this as many times as needed.
* If your Plex client supports the universal transcoder (see "Old and Universal transcoder @ https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250377-Transcoding-Media), tracks will be scrobbled at the start of play. This is due to the way that the universal transcoder writes to the Plex log file. See issue 11 (https://github.com/jesseward/plex-trakt-scrobbler/issues/11) for background discussion.
* We've seen instances when Plex Media Server does not report the length of an audio file. This may occur before a full library analyze has completed. When the track length is not reported by the Plex Media Server, the song will not be scrobble. Try forcing the "Analyze" audio library function.
